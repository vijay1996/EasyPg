# EasyPG
## A client that makes your life easy by providing crud functions to your node application.

### Introduction
*Inspired by Springboot, this package offers SQL query integration to a nodeJs application. Just a few imports will make life a lot easier. You now do not have to manually write db queries. All the basic queries like select, select based on columns, insert, update and delete is now possible via simple function calls. Moreover, updates are in way to provide support for joins and other db features. If you are using Postgresql as you db, connecting to a server is also simplified.
